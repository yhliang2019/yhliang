##  About me

My name is LIANG Yuhong. I am currently a research engineer at Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022, where I was supervised by Prof. Yang Ming-Chang. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from South China University of Technology in 2018.
